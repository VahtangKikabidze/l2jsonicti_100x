Augmentation allows you to bestow a different power on to a weapon. Of course, you may have previously bestowed a specail ability by using a Soul Crystal. But this is a simpler method than that.<br></font> The Stone of Life that is used in augmentation is also greatly affected by its owner,<font color="LEVEL"> so once a weapon is augmented, it can only be used by its owner</font>. If the weapon's grade is beyond your abilities, the augmented effect will not appear.<br><br>
Oh, one more thing -- you can restore a weapon augmented with a Stone of Life to its original state, but it may be costly. Think carefully about what you'd like to do.<br><br>
Would you still like to augment your item?<br><br>
