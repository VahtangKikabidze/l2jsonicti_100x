Hey there! You're looking to get something from me, eh? Well, it's always nice to be recognized for my obvious skill, but all the attention does get a little trying. There are simply so many demands on the time of a jack-of-all-trades like myself. That's why I can't show just anyone my talent; I wouldn't get any work done!
